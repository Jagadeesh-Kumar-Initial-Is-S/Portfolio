    <br/>   ## Note on Issues
    <br/>   Please do not post issues here that are related to your own code when taking the course. Add those in the Udemy Q/A. If you clone THIS repo and there are issues, then you can submit
    
    <br/>   ## Usage
    
    <br/>   ### ES Modules in Node
    
    <br/>   We use ECMAScript Modules in the backend in this project. Be sure to have at least Node v14.6+ or you will need to add the "--experimental-modules" flag.
    
    <br/>    Also, when importing a file (not a package), be sure to add .js at the end or you will get a "module not found" error
    
    <br/>  You can also install and setup Babel if you would like
    
    <br/>   ### Env Variables
    
    <br/>   Create a .env file in then root and add the following
    
    <br/>   ```
    <br/>   NODE_ENV = development
    <br/>   PORT = 5000
    <br/>   MONGO_URI = your mongodb uri
    <br/>JWT_SECRET = 'abc123'
    <br/>PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID = your paypal client id
    <br/>```
    
    <br/>   ### Install Dependencies (frontend & backend)
    
    <br/>   ```
    <br/>   npm install
    <br/>   cd frontend
    <br/>   npm install
    <br/>   ```
    
    <br/>   ### Run
    
    <br/>   ```
    <br/>   # Run frontend (:3000) & backend (:5000)
    <br/>   npm run dev
    
    <br/>    # Run backend only
    <br/>   npm run server
    <br/>   ```
    
    <br/>   ## Build & Deploy
    
    <br/>    ```
    <br/>   # Create frontend prod build
    <br/>   cd frontend
    <br/>  npm run build
    <br/>   ```
    
    <br/>    There is a Heroku postbuild script, so if you push to Heroku, no need to build manually for deployment to Heroku
    
    <br/>   ### Seed Database
    
    <br/>   You can use the following commands to seed the database with some sample users and products as well as destroy all data
    
    <br/>   ```
    <br/>   # Import data
    <br/>   npm run data:import
    
    <br/>   # Destroy data
    <br/>   npm run data:destroy
    <br/>   ```
    
    <br/>  ```
    <!-- Sample User Logins
    
    admin@example.com (Admin)
    123456
    
    john@example.com (Customer)
    123456
    
    jane@example.com (Customer)
    123456 -->
    <br/>   ```
